                                                  Chasing the 10 Pound Monster
Purpose: Chasing the 10 Pound Monster is a biggest loser style web app. The objective is to be the first player to lose 10 pounds. Players will enter their weight daily into the web app. The web app will show only the gain or loss, not the actual weight, for players.

10 pounds is an attainable, measureable, and visible fitness goal. The best part is it can be done in a short time period. So choose, do you want or need to chase the 10 Pound Monster?

Motivation: I work in an office of 25 people. Throughout the year I hosted several biggest loser style challenges using a chalk board to show weekly weigh loss for participants. This arrangement had many pitfalls including failure to get everyone’s weigh-in in a timely manner, weigh-in day on my day off, a participant or myself out of town, and miscalculations in determining weight-loss. I wanted a web-based app that will allow each participant to weigh-in at their own convenient time and place, perfect calculation of weight-loss, and transparency in who won. This would allow me more time to encourage participate to lose weight instead of administration of challenge.
